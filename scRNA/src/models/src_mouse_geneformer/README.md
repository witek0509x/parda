# mouse-Geneformer

Writer: Keita Ito

## Abstract 
This repository contains the source code of mouse-Geneformer for analysing Single-cell RNA-sequence data of mouse. mosue-Geneformer is a model pre-trained on the large mouse single-cell dataset mouse-Genecorpus-20M and designed to map the mouse gene network. The mosue-Geneformer improves the accuracy of cell type classification of mouse cells and enables in silico perturbation experiments on mouse specimens.

Required PyTorch and Python version is as follows:
- PyTorch : 2.0.1
- Python vision : 3.8.10

## Execute
Example of Pretraining run command is as follows:

#### Pretraining
```bash
# mosue-Genecorpus-20M dataset
./start_pretrain_geneformer.sh
```
Downstream task is executed in jupyter files (`cell_classification.ipynb` and `in_silico_perturbation.ipynb`)

## Trained model
